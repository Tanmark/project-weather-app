# Weather App

We have produced a weather app with responsive design, using data from an open API, we followed the designscheme for Iphone XR-XS design 1. 


## The problem

We approached the problem by using fetch requests and jsons in js file. We styled our page with mobile first in mind and used mediaqueries for larger devices. If we had more time we would have made the applicaion more reactive, giving the user more choices, like seeing the weather in a city of their choice.
